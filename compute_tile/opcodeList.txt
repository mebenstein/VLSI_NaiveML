Also note for using computation tiles, there are two files computationTile.v and computationTileInOut.v. computationTileInOut is for having a shared line for the second opcode
and the output, whereas computationTile is for having a seperate line for the output.

NOTE: In order to read the value from the cell, since the second operand and the output share a wire, You must send the tile a NOP instruction to inform it that you're reading
